// @sealant/runtime-client — channel multiplexing.
//
// A `Channel` is one logical byte conduit inside the single length-prefixed control connection
// (ADR-0012). The daemon addresses frames by `channelId`; the client demuxes inbound
// `ServerMessage::Stream` frames into the matching `Channel` and the `Channel` muxes outbound bytes
// back out as `ClientMessage::Stream` frames. This is the substrate the gateway builds SSH channels
// (session attach, direct-tcpip forwards, SFTP subsystem) on top of.
